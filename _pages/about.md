I am a graduate student in the Department of Applied Statistics at [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr), advised by Prof. Jooyoung Lee. My research lies at the intersection of **statistics** and **machine learning**, with a focus on solving real-world problems in healthcare and biomedicine.

My current work spans three main areas:

🔬 **Clinical Research** — Developing causal inference frameworks using target trial emulation to evaluate treatment effectiveness in bladder cancer, addressing key methodological challenges like immortal time bias.

🧠 **Biomedical Signal Analysis** — Applying Multivariate Functional PCA with Square-Root Velocity Framework (MFPCA+SRVF) to classify balance disorders in stroke patients from gait data.

⚙️ **ML for Survival Analysis** — Building Graph Attention Network-based models for survival prediction, combining deep learning with traditional Cox regression approaches.

Before starting my M.S., I earned a B.S. in Applied Statistics from Chung-Ang University. I enjoy transforming complex data into actionable insights, whether in healthcare, finance, or public policy.
