I am a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr), advised by Prof. Jooyoung Lee. I received my M.S. in Statistics Data Science (Feb 2026) and B.S. in Statistics (Feb 2024) from Chung-Ang University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **survival analysis**, **functional data analysis**, and **causal inference**. My master's thesis focused on *Graph Attention Neural Networks for Survival Analysis of Default in Peer-to-Peer Lending*, combining graph-based deep learning with time-to-event modeling for financial applications.

I have also worked on biomedical applications, including stroke gait analysis using principal component analysis and comparative effectiveness research for surgical oncology using target trial emulation approaches.

I was awarded the **CAU Graduate Research Full Scholarship** (Spring 2024 – Fall 2025) covering full tuition and stipend throughout my graduate program.
