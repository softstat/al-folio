## Overview
Built a machine learning pipeline to predict whether customers would apply for specific loan products, enabling targeted marketing and improved customer service for financial institutions.

## Methods
- Processed a large-scale financial dataset with nearly one million customer records
- Engineered features from demographic, transactional, and behavioral data
- Trained and compared multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural networks
- Addressed class imbalance through SMOTE and cost-sensitive learning
- Optimized hyperparameters via Bayesian optimization and cross-validation

## Key Results
- Achieved high predictive accuracy for loan application behavior
- Identified key customer segments most likely to apply for loan products
- Feature importance analysis revealed critical drivers of loan application decisions
