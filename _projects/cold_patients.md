## Overview
Developed a predictive model for classifying cold patients by analyzing sports facility usage patterns in South Korea. The goal was to identify individuals at high risk of respiratory illness based on their behavioral and environmental data.

## Methods
- Collected and preprocessed sports facility usage records linked to health insurance claim data
- Applied multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM
- Performed feature engineering to extract temporal and frequency-based behavioral features
- Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics

## Key Results
- Identified key behavioral indicators correlated with cold susceptibility
- Achieved strong classification performance through ensemble methods
- Demonstrated the feasibility of using non-clinical data for health risk prediction
