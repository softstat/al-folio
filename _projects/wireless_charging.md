## Overview

Conducted a comprehensive site analysis for optimal placement of wireless charging infrastructure on Korean highways. This project aimed to support the transition to electric vehicles by identifying strategic locations for dynamic wireless charging systems.

## Methods

- Analyzed traffic volume data, geographic features, and existing EV infrastructure across Korean highway networks
- Applied K-means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to identify high-potential regions
- Integrated GIS data for spatial analysis and visualization
- Evaluated candidate sites based on traffic density, proximity to urban centers, and construction feasibility

## Key Results

- Identified top candidate highway segments for wireless charging installation
- Created interactive maps visualizing optimal placement zones
- Provided a data-driven framework for infrastructure planning decisions

**Period:** October 2022
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, Folium, GeoPandas
